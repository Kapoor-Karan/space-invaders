## Overview

This project implements a **ðŸŽ® Space Invaders** game using C, aiming to recreate the classic arcade experience. The game features player-controlled spaceships, alien waves, and continuous gameplay with a scoring system. It demonstrates modular design with separate modules for handling different game elements such as the spaceship, aliens, and lasers.
